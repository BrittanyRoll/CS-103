1. I used a for loop. I used the for loop to
   represent one night, as I thought it would be easier to change
   the zombie population by generating new bites that correspond with 
   the previous number of zombies. The while loop I used encompased 
   the for loop and it's counter increases until the number of zombies 
   is equal to the the population, representing the number of nights in one 
   simulation. Since we don't know how many nigths it will take to complete 
   a simulation, a while loop is necessary.

2.  I used a while loop because I though it would be an easy was to 
    iterate through simulations. It's counter increased once one 
    simulation was done. This was repeated until it reached the number 
    of simulations entered by the user.

3. I did this by only increasing the number of zombies after the for
   loop that represented one night was complete. Thus the maximum 
   number of bites was restricted to the number of zombies 
   from the night before. 

4. All of these values become closer to one another as the number of 
   simulations decreases. For example, when I run 300 simulations instead
   of 10000, the avg nights = 9.1467, the min nights = 7, and the max
   nights = 14, this is instead of 8.9769, 6, and 18, respectively. The run
   time is also affected when the number of simulations is very large or very
   small, as larger programs take longer to run.
